To my understanding different kernels different text mode buffers to draw on the screen.
the text mode im using is vga, unfortunately it is not used in uefi and only legacy BIOS.

nonetheless i will use vga 


To do so we must point to address of vga 0xB8000 using a short.


    Writting a character would require us to write a value to the vga memmory (at 0xB8000)
        vga[0] = 0x0758;

    this code writes the letter 'x', how?

    first lets understand the VGA byte format. Each screen cell consist two bytes:
        Attribute byte - colors, background 
            bits 0-3 - text color 
            bits 4-6 - background color 
            bit 7 - if its blinking 0 for false (not used in modern environments like qemu)

        Character byte
            ascii code of symbol              

        The atribute byte is the high byte
