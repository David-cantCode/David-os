0xD1 	Turn speaker on 	
0xD3 	Turn speaker off 	
0xD0 	Stop playing 8 bit channel 	
0xD4 	Resume playback of 8 bit channel 	
0xD5 	Stop playing 16 bit channel 	
0xD6 	Resume playback of 16 bit channel

Command for Mixer port 	Description 	Mixer data port
0x22 	Master volume 	0xLR L=left volume R=right volume min=0x0 max=0xF (default value is 0xCC or 0x11)
0x80 	Set IRQ 







Playing sound

    Reset DSP
    Load sound data to memory
    Set master volume
    Turn speaker on
    Program ISA DMA to transfer
    Set time constant. Notice that the Sound Blaster 16 is able to use sample rates instead of time constants using command 0x41 instead of 0x40.
    You can calculate the time constant like this: Time constant = 65536 - (256000000 / (channels * sampling rate))
    Set output sample rate
    Write transfer mode to DSP
    Write type of sound data
    Write data length to DSP(Low byte/High byte) (You must calculate LENGTH-1 e.g. if is your real length 0x0FFF, you must send 0xFE and 0x0F)
